# opensnet-bridge-client

> A frontend for an OpenSDCP Bridge Server realized as a PWA based on VueJS

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

## Documentation
The documentation has not been created yet. This will be done with the first alpha release of the program. Until then, the comments in the code can be used.

## Get Started
As of right now, this program is still in a very early stage and does not do anything practical because the opensnet-bridge-server (the backend) is not finished yet. I have been working on different parts of the OpenSDCP project since the summer of 2017 and they are all half-finished as of right now, and I plan to share the rest of code as soon as it is somewhat useable - If you still want to try and register your own dashboard module, just add the path to your module's component in /src/router/index.js, import and add the component to the layout of the "Start" group in /src/store.js and start the server.
